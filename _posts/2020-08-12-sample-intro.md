It's pretty cumbersome to get started with push integration. So if you want to develop quickly and conveniently, you can use our sample application server.

<span style="color:yellow">
Sample application server is provided only in development environment. In a production environment, you have to build your own service AppServer.
</span>

You can find the topology [here]({{site.baseurl}}/documents/article/topo-general/) for integrating LINE Planet.<br>
Inter-operation topology for using our sample server is provided below.<br>

### Sample AppClient
LINE Planet provides client sample codes.
You can run Sample AppClient without any programming to test our call functions or you can use the sample codes.<br>
[Sample app client codes]( {{site.baseurl}}/documents/sample/sample-client-codes/).


### Sample AppServer
Sample AppServer does the following:
* Device registration
* Send push on behalf of you

Follow [How to use sample server]( {{site.baseurl}}/documents/quick start/howto-sample/ ) to use.
