Applications can <span style="font-size: 150%; color:lightblue">send a limited size of data during communications</span>.
This is supported in both 1:1 call and conference call communication types.
<br><br><br>
As for a <span style="font-size: 150%; color:lightblue"> conference call</span>, the application can choose
<span style="font-size: 150%; color:lightblue">specific participants</span> as a receiver. <br>
If no specific participant is selected, the data will be sent to <span style="font-size: 150%; color:lightblue">all participants</span>.
<br><br><br>
Sometimes, data transfer could fail even after multiple tries by LINE Planet.
Applications can find out the result of data transfer asynchronously with the result handler callback.
