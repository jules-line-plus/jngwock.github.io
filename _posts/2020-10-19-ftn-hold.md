An application can 
<span style="font-size: 150%; color:lightblue">hold or unhold to send its own media streams</span> with related events.
The behavior of hold API differs depends on the call service type.

* [1:1 call](#11-call)
* [Conference](#conference)

# 1:1 call

When a client holds(Client01), the peer(Client02) should wait un-hold to communication again.
On Client02, an application lets PlanetKit play out some play tone with 
<span style="font-size: 150%; color:orange">callParam::holdTone</span> resource setting.

value that means whether if continuously receives media streams or not during the hold status.
