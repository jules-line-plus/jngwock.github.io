Applications can
<span style="font-size: 150%; color:lightblue">hold or unhold to send its own media streams</span> with related events.
The behavior of the hold API differs, depending on the call service type.

* [1:1 call](#11-call)
* [Conference](#conference)

# 1:1 call

When a client holds (Client01), the peer (Client02) should wait for un-hold to communication again.
On the Client02 side, the application lets PlanetKit play out some play tone with
<span style="font-size: 150%; color:orange">callParam::holdTone</span> resource setting.

When calling the hold() API (Client01), it can be set with the <span style="font-size: 150%; color:orange">`pauseRecv`</span>
value whether to continuously receives media streams or not during the hold status.

# Conference

In a conference call, the hold behavior is different from the 1:1 call type.
* There is no concept of hold tone.
* All receiving media streams are automatically paused by the hold() API.
